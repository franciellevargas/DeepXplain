DeepXplain Summer School 2025


## Introduction to the Scope and Objectives of the Project

- üéØ **Familiarization with Deep Learning Frameworks:**  
  Getting started with popular deep learning libraries such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), including tools and best practices for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.

- üîç **Reading Materials and Discussion on Explainability Techniques:**  
  Exploring model interpretability methods like:
  - [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://shap.readthedocs.io/)
  - [LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/)
  - Attention mechanisms in deep learning

- ‚ö° **Setting up the Development Environment and Datasets:**  
  Preparing the environment for training and testing, including installation of required libraries, configuration of GPU settings, and loading relevant datasets.
