> üìÖ **Phase 1: Preparation & Onboarding**  
> **Duration:** July 1 - July 7
## Introduction to the Scope and Objectives of the Project

- **Familiarization with Deep Learning Frameworks:**  
  Getting started with popular deep learning libraries such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), including tools and best practices for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.

- **Reading Materials and Discussion on Explainability Techniques:**  
  Exploring model interpretability methods like:
  - [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://shap.readthedocs.io/)
  - [LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Introduction to Attention mechanisms in deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism)

- **Setting up the Development Environment and Datasets:**  
  Preparing the environment for training and testing, including installation of required libraries, configuration of GPU settings, and loading relevant datasets.

## Activite 1: :**  # Fine-Tuning BERT and Applying LIME & SHAP for Sentiment Analysis  

## Objective

In this activity, you will explore the full pipeline of **fine-tuning a transformer-based model** for **sentiment analysis**, followed by applying **model-agnostic explainability techniques** to interpret its predictions.

This hands-on exercise aims to help you:

- Understand how to adapt a pre-trained BERT model to a new classification task.
- Learn how to use LIME and SHAP to explain model behavior.
- Critically evaluate what the model learns and how it makes decisions.

## üìù Instructions

### 1. Choose a Sentiment Analysis Dataset

Select a dataset available on the [Hugging Face Datasets Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) for a sentiment classification task.

You can choose from datasets such as:
- `imdb`
- `yelp_review_full`
- `sst2`
- `amazon_polarity`
- or any other dataset that suits your interest and has a sentiment-related label.

> üí° Feel free to explore both binary and multi-class sentiment datasets.

---

### 2. Fine-Tune a Pre-trained BERT Model

Use a model from [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/models), such as `bert-base-uncased`, and fine-tune it on your selected dataset.

Steps include:
- Preprocessing and tokenization.
- Splitting the dataset (train/test).
- Fine-tuning the model using Hugging Face `Trainer` or PyTorch Lightning.
- Evaluating accuracy, F1-score, or other relevant metrics.

You can use the provided notebook (`activity1_lime&shap_bert_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`) as a starting point and customize it to your dataset.

---

### 3. Apply Explainability Methods: LIME and SHAP

After training your model, apply **LIME** and **SHAP** to explain **individual predictions**.

Your task is to:
- Use LIME to highlight the most important words contributing to a given classification.
- Use SHAP (with the `shap.Explainer`) to compute Shapley values for token-level contributions.
- Visualize the explanations and compare how each technique interprets the model's behavior.

---

### 4. Analyze and Reflect

Include your observations directly in the notebook:
- Which words most influenced the predictions?
- Do LIME and SHAP highlight similar tokens?
- Are there any surprising patterns or signs of bias?
- Did the model behave as you expected?

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- A completed and well-commented Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that includes:
  - Dataset loading and justification of your choice
  - Fine-tuning pipeline
  - LIME and SHAP explanations for multiple examples
  - Visualizations (plots, heatmaps, etc.)
  - Analysis and personal reflections
